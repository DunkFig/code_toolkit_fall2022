# TIME AND STATE

This week we're going to begin to explor timing in our programs, and begin to start exploring variables in different "states".

Before we do that Lets take a look at some of the homeworks that you guys made for this week.

[HOMEWORK](Link)

### Timing
- What are some of the ways that we've been exploring timing in our sketches so far?
- What are some of the problems we've been encountering with timing so far?

So far we've been using the frameRate() function and draw to time out our animations. Here's an example below of one of the sketches we created together in class, it's a ellipse moving across the page:

```

let posX = 0

function setup(){
createCanvas(400, 400)
}


function draw(){
background(255, 0, 0)
ellipse(posX, 200, 50, 50)
posX += 1

if(posX > width){
posX = 0
}
}

```

The speed of this ellipse is dictated by two things:
- The frameRate()
- How much we're incramenting posX

Go ahead and play around with these for a moment.

Today we are going to build on this, but instead of using conditionals to ask questions about movement in space, we're going to use them to ask questions about time.

Unlike other time-based digital tools — like Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Audacity, or others — Processing does not give you an explicit, visual timeline. If you want to create timed events, you have to think in terms of numbers.

We're going to be using the p5 function millis() to help us explore time.

This command returns a number that corresponds to the number of milliseconds since the program started running. A millisecond is one thousandth of a second, so 1000 milliseconds = 1 second. millis() is like a stopwatch that starts when your program starts, and keeps running as long as the program is running.

Lets take a look:

```

function draw(){
let millisecond = millis()
console.log(millisecond)
}


```

lets try this out, I want you guys to make a sketch that

```
 Does something for the first three seconds it is running.
```

How about a sketch that:

```
 Waits three seconds, then does something for two seconds.
```

One example could be:

```
let posX = 0;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 0, 0);
  let millisecond = millis();
  ellipse(posX, 200, 50, 50);
  if (millisecond > 3000 && millisecond < 6000) {
    posX += 1;
  }
  

  if (posX > width) {
    posX = 0;
  }
}
```

## What are some limitations of this approach?

Let's start off by bringing in some variables to this conditional. This will help it be a bit more flexible. 
Adding a variable into this conditional means that we'll be able to update it later.

```
let posX = 0;
let startTime = 3000

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 0, 0);
  let millisecond = millis();
  ellipse(posX, 200, 50, 50);
  if (millisecond > startTime && millisecond < startTime + 2000) {
    posX += 1;
  }
  

  if (posX > width) {
    posX = 0;
  }
}

```
We can also add an **Event Handler** into this by adding a keyPressed function. Take a look at this code, lets break down what will happen in it.
```
let posX = 0;
let startTime = 3000

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(255, 0, 0);
  let millisecond = millis();
  ellipse(posX, 200, 50, 50);
  if (millisecond > startTime && millisecond < startTime + 2000) {
    posX += 1;
  }
  

  if (posX > width) {
    posX = 0;
  }
}

function keyPressed(){
startTime = millis()
}

```
### Lets Practice working with this for a little while...
Try completeing each of the following challenges, once you've successfully completed one comment it out.
1.
```
Wait a while, then do something forever
```
2.
```
Wait a while, then do something for a while, then stop
```
3.
```
 Do something for a little while, then stop
 Wait a little while and repeat the above
 ```

## State: a new way to use variables
So far we have been using variables either for numeric things (like shape sizes, positions, or colors) or for Boolean True/False values. All of these things are ways of keeping track of what the program is doing in a given moment.

Today we saw how we could use timing and millis() to affect how the program might change over time.

But what if we want the program to change over time in a way that is not explicitly tied to timing. For example, what if we wanted the user to be able to change what the program was doing? Or if we want the program to operate in different phases or modes, and move through those?

In computer science, the term for keeping track of the status of the program is state. We might ask, what state or phase is the program in? This could be used to implement the levels of a video game for example.

The way to do this is by using variables. This is not very different from anything that we have been doing so far. I just want to show a few examples that emphasize how you can use variables in some slightly different ways.

Let's implement a simple light switch. When the user presses the 'n' key (for "on") the light goes on, and when the user presses the 'f' key (for "off") the light goes off.
Let's start by simply drawing a window "with the light off" (black screen):

```
function setup(){
createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw(){
background(0)
}
```
### How could we solve this problem with the tools we've been using so far?
We could of course use a conditional statment with a boolean operator, using an if or else statement like this:
```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {}

function keyPressed() {
  //this is the keycode for 'n', this can be found here:
  //https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode
  if (keyCode === 78) {
    background(255);
  } else {
    background(0);
  }
}
```
We could also use a boolean to set a particular state. Lets review what we know about boolean variables:
- They exist as either or true or false.
- They cannot be combined with floating point variables or int variables in the way that posX can be added to directionX
- They are assigned names in the same way, and declared using the same conventions (i.e Global V. Local)

Lets go ahead and set one up at the top of our code:

```
let switchState = true

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {}

function keyPressed() {
  //this is the keycode for 'n', this can be found here:
  //https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode
  if (keyCode === 78) {
    background(255);
  } else {
    background(0);
  }
}

```
So how can we use this to change our code. Lets look at one example below:
```
let switchState = true;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  if (switchState) {
    background(0);
  } else {
    background(255);
  }
}

function keyPressed() {
  //this is the keycode for 'n', this can be found here:
  //https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode
  if (keyCode == 78) {
    switchState = true;
  }
  if (keyCode == 70) {
    switchState = false;
  }
}

```
There's actually a really fun way that we can simplify this code, we can reduce this down to one button and just tell that button to switch our switchState to the *Opposite State* the way that we write that is pretty simple
```
let switchState = true;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  if (switchState) {
    background(0);
  } else {
    background(255);
  }
}

function keyPressed() {
  //this is the keycode for 'n', this can be found here:
  //https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode
  if (keyCode == 78) {
    switchState =! switchState;
  }
}

```
**WOA**, lets break this down a little bit, for me learning this fealt like I was learning a cartoon secret.
```
switchState =! switchState
```
This is essentially telling the computer:
"Whatever switchstate is, make it the opposite."

Of course switching something ON/Off only scratches the surface. We can have a variety of different states that are toggled on and off for our programs. Why don't you continue on with this code and add a toggle switch for 
 - An ellipse in the middle of the screen
 - An Rectangle at the bottom of the screen. 

Once your finished you can check your answers by looking at this sketch right [Here](https://editor.p5js.org/dunkFig/sketches/jIqi2nxp1)

## Why do you think its advantageous to use this in certain instances?
### We can actually get much more complex with states, and can toggle between more than 2.

Say for instance we wanted to toggle between a variety of different states, instead of using a variable which is assigned a Boolean Varibale we can use a variable that has an integer value and use this as a means to activate a whole plethora of things:

Lets take a look at the following example:


```
let backgroundState = 1;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  if (backgroundState == 1) {
    background(255, 22, 13);
  }
  if (backgroundState == 2) {
    background(100, 255, 77);
  }
  if (backgroundState == 3) {
    background(55, 132, 255);
  }
}

function keyPressed() {
// This is the keyCode for the Space Bar
  if (keyCode == 32) {
    backgroundState += 1;
    if (backgroundState > 3) {
      backgroundState = 1;
    }
  }
}

```

## Lets mentally walk through this entire set of code before we plug it into p5.
Whats happening? Here?

## Your challenge now:
- Add a distinct composition to each 'State'
- Add 1 additional state
- Make sure that is allowed to cycle through to the beginning once it reaches the end.
