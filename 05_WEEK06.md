# TIME AND STATE

This week we're going to begin to explor timing in our programs, and begin to start exploring variables in different "states".

Before we do that Lets take a look at some of the homeworks that you guys made for this week.

## Timing
- What are some of the ways that we've been exploring timing in our sketches so far?
- What are some of the problems we've been encountering with timing so far?

So far we've been using the frameRate() function and draw to time out our animations. Here's an example below of one of the sketches we created together in class, it's a ellipse moving across the page:

```

let posX = 0

function setup(){
createCanvas(400, 400)
}


function draw(){
background(255, 0, 0)
ellipse(posX, 200, 50, 50)
posX += 1

if(posX > width){
posX = 0
}
}

```

The speed of this ellipse is dictated by two things:
- The frameRate()
- How much we're incramenting posX

Go ahead and play around with these for a moment.

Today we are going to build on this, but instead of using conditionals to ask questions about movement in space, we're going to use them to ask questions about time.

Unlike other time-based digital tools — like Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Audacity, or others — Processing does not give you an explicit, visual timeline. If you want to create timed events, you have to think in terms of numbers.

We're going to be using the p5 function millis() to help us explore time.

This command returns a number that corresponds to the number of milliseconds since the program started running. A millisecond is one thousandth of a second, so 1000 milliseconds = 1 second. millis() is like a stopwatch that starts when your program starts, and keeps running as long as the program is running.

Lets take a look:

```

function draw(){
let millisecond = millis()
console.log(millisecond)
}


```

lets try this out, I want you guys to make a sketch that

```
 Does something for the first three seconds it is running.
```

How about a sketch that:

```
 Waits three seconds, then does something for two seconds.
```
