# MIDTERM

- Begin to consider your midterm ( Due Week 9 )
- Plan Due October 14th, Midterm due October 28th.


Choose one of the following two project options:

## Create an interactive game.

It should meet the following requirements:
It should have a visual representation of a "character" that moves around. The character can be anything: realistic or graphical, a raster image or a drawing with using 2D Primitives, anthropomorphic or not, human-like or animal-like or something else, a vehicle or a textual word or a rock or a blob of color.

The "character" should be able to move around in space based on keyboard controls from the user.

The game can be from any viewpoint or perspective: top-down, side view, on ground or flying in the sky or outter space or underwater or in an abstract world of ideas and concepts. I would not recommend a side-scroller as this can pose some challenges. I would also not recommend trying to simulate much (or any) physics. Even jumping can get complicated.

There should be at least one example of some kind of blockage: a visual representation of something that stops or impedes the movement of the character. (More than one would be great, but at least one.) Like the character, the blockage can be rendered as: a raster image or drawn with 2D Primitives, animal or vegetable or mineral, or something more abstract like text. Use if statements to check the character's movement and to determine if movement should be stopped.

There should be at least one thing that moves "on its own". This can be a "bad guy," "good guy," or a "prize." It can be something that the character has to touch or avoid, or it can just be a benign set decoration with no effect. As with the character and the blockage, it can be a raster image or drawn with 2D Primitives, and can be any type of thing, realistic or abstract.

There should be some goal. Keep it simple. It can be as simple as moving to some part of the screen, or touching or avoiding the moving thing above.

When the goal is met, there should be a second level level. (More levels are are fine, but finish all the requirements stated here before working on that.) You can indicate the level visually in any way you wish. Different colors, shapes, raster images, changes in the way the character or "bad guys" are drawn, or anything. You will implement this with an if statement, a state variable (which we'll talk about week 6), and functions, (which we'll talk about week 7).

## Data visualization

A data visualization is like a chart or a graph that attempts to convey some kind of information visually, through geometric pattern and illustration. But instead of a simple bar chart, line graph, or pie chart, you will use non-traditional shapes and patterns to represent your data.

Consider the work of Edward Tufte, W.E.B. DuBois (Smithsonian, Hyperallergic), or simply browse publications like The New York Times for the innovative visualizations that they often produce.

Step one of this project will be to find some data to work with. This can be from a published dataset like the ones at NYC.gov/data, it can be something that you gather yourself through observation or empirical research, or it can be something you collect from friends or through a survey. Your dataset can be related to the weather, your personal life, economics, societal issues, history, literature, or something else.

Once you find this data you will need to do some work to get it into arrays for you to use within your program. This will involve using a common exchange format like comma-separated values (CSV). I can help you with this step. Once you have that, you will use loops to iterate over this data and render it in some way. Your sketch should have some degree of interactivity so that the user can use the keyboard or mouse to change the visualization in some way. For example, perhaps the user can toggle between two years, or zoom in on a specific piece of data.

In working on this, think about the biases and affordances of this method of argumentation. What does a geometrical display of data do well, and what does it do poorly? What kinds of arguments can one make with visualizing data? And what kinds are impossible? What modes of understanding does information presented in this way encourage?

Regardless of which of those options you choose, remember that one objective of this course is to use hands-on engagement with the development of software as a way to help you develop a deeper understanding of what software is, what it does, and how it does. Thus, one of the primary goals of this project is to create a software project that helps you think about this.

One aspect of this is to try to create something that fits this tool: something that is necessarily a hand-coded software project. Don't try to implement something with P5 that would be better done with Adobe Premiere, or Excel, or Photoshop, or a simple web page. Think about how you are taking advantage of the unique affordances of computer program code. Is it interactive? Does it generate an inhuman amount of repetition? Does it process some amount of data that would be difficult or time-consuming for an individual to do?

Keep in mind all of our readings thus far, and think about how your project might function as example or evidence for those texts â€” i.e. something we might say that those theories apply to. But also, think about how your project and your process of making it can help you develop your own analysis and theories about how software functions, and perhaps demonstrate this understanding for others.
