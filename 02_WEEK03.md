# Week 03

This week were going to finally start animating some of our programs, adding interactivity, and using some more functions and variables which are part of p5.

Let's go over some [Homework Examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oE-frETSfRk5mj9mkblAWrk3HGop5uMrPbmpaRO-pC0/edit#gid=0), what were some of the things that were tricky for you in this assignment?

### First Lets review some of the things that we've gone over so far:
- Cartesian Plane (Pixel coordinates)
- The setup() code block or 'function'
- RGBA values
- Using 2d Primitives (rect, ellipses, line, etc...)
- Using Variables (storing values inside of variables)
- adding variables and dividing, using variables that are internal to p5 (height, width, mouseX)
- Using the random function to add variability to our programs

### LETS GET INTERACTIVE
- First lets take a look at some interactive new media works:
  - [Camille UtterBack, Untitled 05](http://camilleutterback.com/projects/untitled-5/)
  - [Daniel Rozin, Wooden Mirror](https://www.elektramontreal.ca/daniel-rozin)
  - [YellowTail, Golan Levin](https://vimeo.com/661922)

#### Making Our Programs Move.
 Up until now we have mainly been avoiding the draw function, but today we're finally going to crack into it. 
In your p5 web editor I want you to go ahead and enter in the following code:

```

function setup(){
  console.log("I'm being printed once")
}

function draw(){
  console.log("I'm being printed many times")
}

```

If you play this you'll see that while the setup function runs at the beginning of our program, the draw function runs many times per second. In fact the default 'framerate' for p5 is 60 frames per second. Which means that everything that we put inside of the draw loop is being executed 60 times EVERY SECOND. You can change this by using the internal funtion 'frameRate()':

```

// You can put the specific number of frames that you want per second in as a parameter.
framerate(60)

```

Now that we know that this draw function is running multiple times a second, lets go ahead and introduce some internal p5 Variables which will allow us to move some things around. Everybody say hello to mouseX & mouseY. These two variables get the Mouse X position and Mouse Y position and let you use them dynamically. The value that it gives are the cartesian pixel values that we've been using to designate where to put our 2D primitives. What do you think will happen when we run the code below?


```

function setup(){
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255,0,0)
}

function draw(){
  rect(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20)
}

```

### Woa this is a lot of fun but lets break down what's going on?
  - Why are there tons of squares being printed as opposed to one being dragged across the screen?
  - why does my sketch start with a rectangle in the corner?
  - Why does nothing happen on the canvas when my mouse is not on the canvas?
 

The reason were getting tons of squares as oppposed to just one is because we're only printing our background once in the setup function. The new Squares are then just being added on top of eachother. If we wanted to make it seem as if we were just dragging one square across the screen we would need to add a 'background' to our draw function so that is is printed just as often as the square? Try it out!


### Can you think of any other internal p5 functions or variables which might behave differently inside of the draw function?
  - That's so RANDOM, I can't think of anything.
  - That's right! while we were getting one random() value before when used in setup we will now be getting a random value 60 TIMES PER SECOND.
  - **Serious Disclaimer - If you have photsensitivity please be careful in playing with this**
  - Go ahead and try out this code:
  
  
  ```
 function setup(){
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255)
  }
  
  
 function draw(){
  let rValue = random(0, 255)
  let gValue = random(0, 255)
  let bValue = random(0, 255)
  
fill(rValue, gValue, bValue)
rect(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50) 
  }

```

Play with this for five minutes and see what kind of crazy stuff you can make then we're going to take a quick break.

# We're Back
Now that were back lets take a look at a few more special p5 variables and functions that we can use to create some interactive programs.
First lets take a look at this code:


```

function setup(){
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  
}

function draw(){
  background(255)
  line(0, 0, mouseX, mouseY)
}

```

Pretty neat right? But now I want to try and change the strokeWeight dynamically based on how far away the mouse is from the coordinates (0, 0). Until now we have been assessing distance based on estimation, and calculating it ourselves. Luckily p5 has a really wonderful function that allows us to compute the distance between two points. The dist() function.

### [the dist() function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/dist)
The dist() function takes 4 parameters, the x,y coordinates of the first point, and the x,y coordinates of our second point. we can assign this value to a variable and use it in our code.


'''

function setup(){
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  
}

function draw(){
  background(255)
  let distance = dist(0, 0, mouseX, mouseY)
  
  strokeWeight(distance)
  line(0, 0, mouseX, mouseY)
}

'''


## Ok this is neat, but honestly it's a little clunky. Is there a way we can "Turn down the volume" on this variable a bit?
I'm so glad you asked! Most of the time we can't just take one varible and plug it into a parameter without *tweaking* it a bit to work with our program. Before I introduce another function for us to use why don't you try and use some arithmatic to make this strokeWeight a bit more pallateble gradation.

- try and get the strokeWieght between 0 and 10

### [The Map() function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map)
The map function is something you will use a lot in p5. I promise. The map function takes 5 parameters:

```
map(the number you have, the minimum right now, the maximum right now, the minimum you want, the maximum you want)

```
This is a lot so lets break it down slowly. Map essentially takes one range and converts it into another range, the sketch we just made the stroke width goes from 1 to 400, but what if we wanted to take our our stroke width to change while maintaining the same interaction? 

'''

function setup(){
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  
}

function draw(){
  background(255)
  let distance = dist(0, 0, mouseX, mouseY)
  let strokeVar = map(distance, 0, 400, 0, 10)
  
  strokeWeight(strokeVar)
  line(0, 0, mouseX, mouseY)
}

'''

#### Go ahead and play around with this a little bit. Then I have an excercise for you.
  - We're going to create a rectangle that starts at 0, 0, and changes the size of its width from 0 to 200 by using the map function on mouseX. Essentially we are trying to create a program that makes our rectangle 200 pixels wide when mouseX is on 400, and 0 pixels long when its on 0. 
  -  Feel free to try this on your own or follow the instructions below. 

### Challenge 2
  - create a canvas that is 400 x 400 pixels across with createCanvas()
  - create a rectangle that starts on coordinates (0, 0) with height of 400, and in the place of the width parameter put 'widthVar'
  - like this:
  ```
  rect(0, 0, widthVar, 400)
  //The final parameter can also be filled with *height*
  ```
  - above this declare a your widthVar variable and make it equal to a map function:
  ```
  let widthVar = map()
  ```
  - our first parameter is going to be mouseX, because this is the range we are trying to convert. 
  ```
  let widthVar = map(mouseX, )
  ```
  - our second parameter is going to be the **mimum** value that mouse X can reach **right now**. What do you think that is? feel free to console.log() mouseX to           explore and find out.
  - our third parameter is going to be the **maximum** value that mouseX can reach **right now**. *Hint* this value can also be written using a special p5 variable. 
  - Our forth parameter is going to be the **minimum** value that we want widthVar to be.
  - Our fifth parameter is going to be the **maximum** value we want widthVar to be.
  - make sure that we don't see more than **one** rectangle. There should be no overlaps. At this point when your mouse is on the furtherst right of the canvas your      rectangle wshould be about half the width of the entire canvas. 
  - Now that you've done this, go ahead and declare a new variable called 'heightVar'
  - Now go ahead and repeat this process with the height of the rectangle. You are aiming to have its maximum value be 200, just like its width.
  - Finally go ahead and use the dist() function or the map() function to change the fill of the recatngle. 
  - The end result should be that when you have your mouse on the bottom right corner of the canvas, your rectangle is roughly 200 x 200 pixels across starting from       0,0

  - Go ahead and explore if you think that you've figure it out go ahead and check your answers by looking at [this](https://editor.p5js.org/dunkFig/sketches/gMVN1ZTnzN) sketch. 


## HTML
From now on were going to be adding our responses directly into the HTML of our sketches. The way that we'll do this is pretty simple. First start off by looking at the side tab:


## pmouseX & pmouseY

# Homework

## Week 3 — Homework assignment
## due: Friday, September 23, (Before Class)

- Review this week's lecture notes.
- Create an abstract interaction. Fill the window with a dynamic, interactive, kinetic composition that is responsive to the user's mouse. Try to create something that is expresive, so that the user's movements and gestures are represented in the visual output.

Use mouseX, mouseY and map() so that your draw commands change as you move the mouse. Adjust the x and y positions, but also widths and heights, colors, etc. Can you experiment also with dist? So maybe for example the faster the user moves the mouse, the bolder your composition becomes.

### Try to do at least three of these tasks:
- Create 3 or more shapes that move together.
- Create two shapes that move in opposite directions.
- Create one shape with a size that ranges from filling the entire screen to disappearing completely.
- Create shapes that overlap and have colors that vary with some transparency to watch the interplay of colors.
- These are just suggestions — use them as a starting point for experimentation.
- Experiment with putting background() inside setup() and then moving it to inside draw() or not. What happens?

### User test 
- let someone else play with your sketch, does it illicit the response that your going for?
- Ask someone else to explain the interaction, what does this tell you about your code.
- Write about this in your response. 

### Response posted on HTML
- Write a 200 word response explaining your process and what you want to see next.
- Add this response to the HTML of your sketch, and link just the sketch to the [HOMEWORK ROSTER](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oE-frETSfRk5mj9mkblAWrk3HGop5uMrPbmpaRO-pC0/edit#gid=0)
- Here's a [youtube link](https://youtu.be/J9QqqWGvxXI) going over exactly how we would do this.
