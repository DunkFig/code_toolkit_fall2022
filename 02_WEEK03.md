# Week 03

This week were going to finally start animating some of our programs, adding interactivity, and using some more functions and variables which are part of p5.

### First Lets review some of the things that we've gone over so far:
- Cartesian Plane (Pixel coordinates)
- The setup() code block or 'function'
- RGBA values
- Using 2d Primitives (rect, ellipses, line, etc...)
- Using Variables (storing values inside of variables)
- adding variables and dividing, using variables that are internal to p5 (height, width, mouseX)
- Using the random function to add variability to our programs

### LETS GET INTERACTIVE
- First lets take a look at some interactive new media works:
  - [Camille UtterBack, Untitled 05](http://camilleutterback.com/projects/untitled-5/)
  - [Daniel Rozin, Wooden Mirror](https://www.elektramontreal.ca/daniel-rozin)
  - [YellowTail, Golan Levin](https://vimeo.com/661922)

#### Making Our Programs Move.
 Up until now we have mainly been avoiding the draw function, but today we're finally going to crack into it. 
In your p5 web editor I want you to go ahead and enter in the following code:
```
function setup(){
  console.log('I'm being printed once')
}

function draw(){
  console.log('I'm being printed many times')
}
```
