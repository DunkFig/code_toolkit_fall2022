# Week 03

This week were going to finally start animating some of our programs, adding interactivity, and using some more functions and variables which are part of p5.

### First Lets review some of the things that we've gone over so far:
- Cartesian Plane (Pixel coordinates)
- The setup() code block or 'function'
- RGBA values
- Using 2d Primitives (rect, ellipses, line, etc...)
- Using Variables (storing values inside of variables)
- adding variables and dividing, using variables that are internal to p5 (height, width, mouseX)
- Using the random function to add variability to our programs

### LETS GET INTERACTIVE
- First lets take a look at some interactive new media works:
  - [Camille UtterBack, Untitled 05](http://camilleutterback.com/projects/untitled-5/)
  - [Daniel Rozin, Wooden Mirror](https://www.elektramontreal.ca/daniel-rozin)
  - [YellowTail, Golan Levin](https://vimeo.com/661922)

#### Making Our Programs Move.
 Up until now we have mainly been avoiding the draw function, but today we're finally going to crack into it. 
In your p5 web editor I want you to go ahead and enter in the following code:

```

function setup(){
  console.log("I'm being printed once")
}

function draw(){
  console.log("I'm being printed many times")
}

```

If you play this you'll see that while the setup function runs at the beginning of our program, the draw function runs many times per second. In fact the default 'framerate' for p5 is 60 frames per second. Which means that everything that we put inside of the draw loop is being executed 60 times EVERY SECOND. You can change this by using the internal funtion 'frameRate()':

```

// You can put the specific number of frames that you want per second in as a parameter.
framerate(60)

```

Now that we know that this draw function is running multiple times a second, lets go ahead and introduce some internal p5 Variables which will allow us to move some things around. Everybody say hello to mouseX & mouseY. These two variables get the Mouse X position and Mouse Y position and let you use them dynamically. The value that it gives are the cartesian pixel values that we've been using to designate where to put our 2D primitives. What do you think will happen when we run the code below?

```

function setup(){
  createCanvas(400, 400)
  background(255,0,0)
}

function draw(){
  rect(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20)
}

```

### Woa this is a lot of fun but lets break down what's going on?
  - Why are there tons of squares being printed as opposed to one being dragged across the screen?
  - why does my sketch start with a rectangle in the corner?
  - Why does nothing happen on the canvas when my mouse is not on the canvas?
 

The reason were getting tons of squares as oppposed to just one is because we're only printing our background once in the setup function. The new Squares are then just being added on top of eachother. If we wanted to make it seem as if we were just dragging one square across the screen we would need to add a 'background' to out draw function.
