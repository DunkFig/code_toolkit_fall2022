# P5 OUTSIDE OF THE BROWSER
Hey everyone, this week we're going to be downloading our first IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write code outside of the browswer. The IDE that we're going to be using for this class is called Visual Studios Code, and you can download it **[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)**

These environments often have plugins for a variety of different languages, and give us more control on the assets we load in, and the workflow that we use to make our programs. Go ahead and download this softare and then come to the next step.

## Navigating the new Environment
