# Week 04
Hey everyone hope you had a good time working on the homework, were going to start off today by looking at recent piece that was created by Dries Depooter
then we're going to go over our homework, review some things from last week, and finally get into some **CONDITIONALS**

### Homework


### Review
 - x & Y coordinates
 - 2D Primitives
 - RGBA value?
 - Draw VS Setup Function
 - Variables?
 - P5 Special Variables (Height, Width, mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY)
 - p5 Special Functions ( rand(), map(), dist() )

## Conditionals?

A big part of programming is settin of a series of actions if a variable meets a certain condition. Lets start our example off by using an internal p5 variable that we're familiar with: mouseX. Say we wanted a certain part of our code to fire after mouseX passed beyond 300th pixel. We can write this statement out like so:

```
function draw() {
if(mouseX > 300){
//you put what you want to happen here.
}
```

whatever we put inbetween these curly brackets will fire only after the condition is met. Lets try this out by entering the following code below:

```
function draw() {
  if(mouseX > 300){
     fill(255, 0, 0)
     rect(200, 0, 200, height)
  }
```

Did everything happen as you expected? What went differently? For me one of the things that I did not expect was the fact that the red rectangle stayed there even after I had taken my mouse away, why do you think this is? Well we had a conditional for what should happen ater our mouse goes over 300 pixels, but after that we haven't given any instructions for what our computer is supposed to do. We can use another conditional called **else** which gives us a way to say what we want to happen if the condition is *not* met.

```
function draw(){
  if(mouseX > 200){
    fill(255, 0, 0)
    rect(200, 0, 200, height)
  }else{
    background(255)
  }
  }
```
There's tons of ways that we can set up conditionals using arithmetic, below are a few examples that we'll go through:

```
if(x > 50)   // If a value is greater or less than a number
if(x >= 50)   // If a value is greater than or equal to a number, or less than or equal to a number
if(x == 50)   // If a value is equal to a number. This is different than '=' which assigns a value, this '==' checks if two numbers are the same. 
if(x > 50 || x < 30)      // You can use these two lines as an or statement, where if either of these conditions are true then the condition is met. 
if(x > 50 && x < 70)     // We can use multiple parameteres to set a condition, these additions can be added on by adding '&&'
if(x != 50)     // we can also see if our value is *not* equal to a number
if(x == true)    // we can check if a value has a true or false value. 

```

### [Else & If](https://editor.p5js.org/dunkFig/sketches/Xyjzl68iC)
Here's the example we went over above.

## Challenge 1
 - We are going to write a program which allows a 100 x 100 red square to appear in the middle of our canvas only when we have our mouse hovering over it. Otherwise the canvas shoule be entirely blank. If you want to try this on your own go ahead, otherwise follow the steps below:
 - Start out by creating our red square in the middle of the canvas, if we know that the height and width are going to be 100 each then where would we place our rectangle?


```
function draw(){
   fill(255, 0, 0)
   rect(?, ?, 100, 100)
}
```

- Once we've gone ahead and placed it we can incramentally start adjusting our conditional statement, lets start off by considering where our rectangle starts, this should be the same X value that you used to place the rectangle. We know that if our mouse goes over this value we'll want out rectangle to appear, we can write that below like this:

```
if(mouseX > ?){
   fill(255, 0, 0)
   rect(?, ?, 100, 100)
}
```

- Great! Go ahead and test out what happens.
- Now we're back to the same problem we were at in the beginning, lets go ahead and add more conditions to our if statment. How long is our rectangle, at what point do we want it to stop appearing?


```
if(mouseX > ? && mouseX < ?){
   fill(255, 0, 0)
   rect(?, ?, 100, 100)
}
```

-At this point you can go ahead and enter an *else* statment too try and help you trouble shoot. The way that I've been clearing the canvas is by saying 


```
else{
background(255)
}
```
- Now what you'll have to do is implement the same consitions for your Y axis. 
- Once your finished you can go ahead and check you work by checking [here](https://editor.p5js.org/dunkFig/sketches/divT7FDTr)


## More Interactivity
- Now that we have some of the basics of if and else statments were going to take a look at some more p5 functions which help us create condition statements based on some of our desktop controls. 
- Go ahead and open up this example below:
### [mousepressed & keyPressed](https://editor.p5js.org/dunkFig/sketches/_KRY77Tt1)



## Moving Things
 - Using mouseX and mouseY are great, but a lot of the times we're going to want to program things that move on their own. Right now we're going to start finally animating some objects on are canvas. Everyone go ahead and get started by setting up. A sketch that looks like this:

```
let xPos = 50

function setup() {
 createCanvas(400, 400)
}

function draw(){
  background(255)
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(xPos, 50, 50, 50)
}
```

Without using mouseX or mouseY how can we animate this circle so that it moves across the canvas on it's own. Remember that the draw function updates 60 times per second unless we change the frameRate. 

What we're about to do is going to seem like a cartoon movie, but we'll break it down step by step. 

```
let xPos = 50

function setup() {
 createCanvas(400, 400)
}

function draw(){
  background(255)
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(xPos, 50, 50, 50)
  xPos += 1
}
```

Essentially what we're doing is were adding 1 to the variable xPos everytime the draw function fires. Lets go ahead and give this addition a name and call it xSpeed.

```
let xPos = 50
let xSpeed = 1

function setup() {
 createCanvas(400, 400)
}

function draw(){
  background(255)
  fill(255, 0, 0)
  ellipse(xPos, 50, 50, 50)
  xPos += xSpeed
}
```
### CHALLENGE 2
Ok now we're cooking with gas, but how can we add a conditional so that this ball bounces back off of the walls? Everyone take a crack at figuring out how they would write this out. If you get it to bounce off one of the walls can you get it to bounce on the left wall when it comes back?
- I'll give you two hints:
- 1. You can use an *or* statement here to change the direction in a more concise way. Example( if( x > something || x < something)  )
- 2. By multiplying a variable by -1 at a certain time you can maintain the speed while changing the direction.

# Homework

- Review this week's lecture notes.

**Conditionals and keyboard interaction.** Create a composition that is dynamic and changing in discrete and discontinuous ways (unlike last week when you created dynamic interaction in smooth and continuous ways). You can start with your abstract interaction from last week (part 2) as a starting point, or you can create something totally new.

- Use conditionals (if statements) so that your sketch makes abrupt, non-continuous changes. Use conditionals with keyboard interaction so that the user can affect the behavior with key commands. Do you want these keyboard commands to be single presses? If so, use the new def keyPressed(): block. Do you want the keys to be held down? If so, use key inside a conditional in the draw(): function.

- Making things move (on their own). Build on part 1 or start something new, but either way, please start a new p5 sketch. (If you're building on part 1, say File > Save As... and rename.) Add some elements to your composition that move on their own. Think about how they are moving (horizontally? vertically? both? Always in one direction, or in a changing direction?) and add a variable for each dynamic aspect.

- Use conditionals to control this motion. For example, maybe your moving elements bounce off the walls of the draw window, or consider integraing a raster image as a background and create the effect that your moving elements are crossing a road, or through a pipe. Can you use keyboard interaction to influence the movement? For example to change speed, direction, or something else.

- **Consider this an optional challenge if you're up for it.** At this point, you have all the elements to implement something like basic game play. Can you create an object or character that the user controls with the keyboard, as well as one or more elements that move on their own, so that the character must touch or avoid the elements? You can use dist() (reference) to determine the distance between two x,y points — perhaps you can use this to determine if two elements have collided (if their distance is less than some amount).


# MIDTERM

- Begin to consider your midterm ( Due Week 9 )
- Plan Due October 14th, Midterm due October 28th.


Choose one of the following two project options:

## Create an interactive game.

It should meet the following requirements:
It should have a visual representation of a "character" that moves around. The character can be anything: realistic or graphical, a raster image or a drawing with using 2D Primitives, anthropomorphic or not, human-like or animal-like or something else, a vehicle or a textual word or a rock or a blob of color.

The "character" should be able to move around in space based on keyboard controls from the user.

The game can be from any viewpoint or perspective: top-down, side view, on ground or flying in the sky or outter space or underwater or in an abstract world of ideas and concepts. I would not recommend a side-scroller as this can pose some challenges. I would also not recommend trying to simulate much (or any) physics. Even jumping can get complicated.

There should be at least one example of some kind of blockage: a visual representation of something that stops or impedes the movement of the character. (More than one would be great, but at least one.) Like the character, the blockage can be rendered as: a raster image or drawn with 2D Primitives, animal or vegetable or mineral, or something more abstract like text. Use if statements to check the character's movement and to determine if movement should be stopped.

There should be at least one thing that moves "on its own". This can be a "bad guy," "good guy," or a "prize." It can be something that the character has to touch or avoid, or it can just be a benign set decoration with no effect. As with the character and the blockage, it can be a raster image or drawn with 2D Primitives, and can be any type of thing, realistic or abstract.

There should be some goal. Keep it simple. It can be as simple as moving to some part of the screen, or touching or avoiding the moving thing above.

When the goal is met, there should be a second level level. (More levels are are fine, but finish all the requirements stated here before working on that.) You can indicate the level visually in any way you wish. Different colors, shapes, raster images, changes in the way the character or "bad guys" are drawn, or anything. You will implement this with an if statement, a state variable (which we'll talk about week 6), and functions, (which we'll talk about week 7).

## Data visualization

A data visualization is like a chart or a graph that attempts to convey some kind of information visually, through geometric pattern and illustration. But instead of a simple bar chart, line graph, or pie chart, you will use non-traditional shapes and patterns to represent your data.

Consider the work of Edward Tufte, W.E.B. DuBois (Smithsonian, Hyperallergic), or simply browse publications like The New York Times for the innovative visualizations that they often produce.

Step one of this project will be to find some data to work with. This can be from a published dataset like the ones at NYC.gov/data, it can be something that you gather yourself through observation or empirical research, or it can be something you collect from friends or through a survey. Your dataset can be related to the weather, your personal life, economics, societal issues, history, literature, or something else.

Once you find this data you will need to do some work to get it into arrays for you to use within your program. This will involve using a common exchange format like comma-separated values (CSV). I can help you with this step. Once you have that, you will use loops to iterate over this data and render it in some way. Your sketch should have some degree of interactivity so that the user can use the keyboard or mouse to change the visualization in some way. For example, perhaps the user can toggle between two years, or zoom in on a specific piece of data.

In working on this, think about the biases and affordances of this method of argumentation. What does a geometrical display of data do well, and what does it do poorly? What kinds of arguments can one make with visualizing data? And what kinds are impossible? What modes of understanding does information presented in this way encourage?

Regardless of which of those options you choose, remember that one objective of this course is to use hands-on engagement with the development of software as a way to help you develop a deeper understanding of what software is, what it does, and how it does. Thus, one of the primary goals of this project is to create a software project that helps you think about this.

One aspect of this is to try to create something that fits this tool: something that is necessarily a hand-coded software project. Don't try to implement something with P5 that would be better done with Adobe Premiere, or Excel, or Photoshop, or a simple web page. Think about how you are taking advantage of the unique affordances of computer program code. Is it interactive? Does it generate an inhuman amount of repetition? Does it process some amount of data that would be difficult or time-consuming for an individual to do?

Keep in mind all of our readings thus far, and think about how your project might function as example or evidence for those texts — i.e. something we might say that those theories apply to. But also, think about how your project and your process of making it can help you develop your own analysis and theories about how software functions, and perhaps demonstrate this understanding for others.
