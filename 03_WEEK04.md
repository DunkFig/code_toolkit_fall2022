# Week 04
Hey everyone hope you had a good time working on the homework, were going to start off today by looking at recent piece that was created by Dries Depooter
then we're going to go over our homework, review some things from last week, and finally get into some **CONDITIONALS**

### Homework


### Review
 - x & Y coordinates
 - 2D Primitives
 - RGBA value?
 - Draw VS Setup Function
 - Variables?
 - P5 Special Variables (Height, Width, mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY)
 - p5 Special Functions ( rand(), map(), dist() )

## Conditionals?

A big part of programming is settin of a series of actions if a variable meets a certain condition. Lets start our example off by using an internal p5 variable that we're familiar with: mouseX. Say we wanted a certain part of our code to fire after mouseX passed beyond 300th pixel. We can write this statement out like so:

```
function draw() {
if(mouseX > 300){
//you put what you want to happen here.
}
```

whatever we put inbetween these curly brackets will fire only after the condition is met. Lets try this out by entering the following code below:

```
function draw() {
  if(mouseX > 300){
     fill(255, 0, 0)
     rect(200, 0, 200, height)
  }
```

Did everything happen as you expected? What went differently? For me one of the things that I did not expect was the fact that the red rectangle stayed there even after I had taken my mouse away, why do you think this is? Well we had a conditional for what should happen ater our mouse goes over 300 pixels, but after that we haven't given any instructions for what our computer is supposed to do. We can use another conditional called **else** which gives us a way to say what we want to happen if the condition is *not* met.

```
function draw(){
  if(mouseX > 200){
    fill(255, 0, 0)
    rect(200, 0, 200, height)
  }else{
    background(255)
  }
  }
```
There's tons of ways that we can set up conditionals using arithmetic, below are a few examples that we'll go through:

```
if(x > 50)   // If a value is greater or less than a number
if(x >= 50)   // If a value is greater than or equal to a number, or less than or equal to a number
if(x == 50)   // If a value is equal to a number. This is different than '=' which assigns a value, this '==' checks if two numbers are the same. 
if(x > 50 && x < 70)     // We can use multiple parameteres to set a condition, these additions can be added on by adding '&&'
if(x != 50)     // we can also see if our value is *not* equal to a number
if(x == true)    // we can check if a value has a true or false value. 

```

## Challenge 1
 - We are going to write a program which allows a 100 x 100 red square to appear in the middle of our canvas only when we have our mouse hovering over it. Otherwise the canvas shoule be entirely blank. If you want to try this on your own go ahead, otherwise follow the steps below:
 - Start out by creating our red square in the middle of the canvas, if we know that the height and width are going to be 100 each then where would we place our rectangle?


```
function draw(){
   fill(255, 0, 0)
   rect(?, ?, 100, 100)
}
```

- Once we've gone ahead and placed it we can incramentally start adjusting our conditional statement, lets start off by considering where our rectangle starts, this should be the same X value that you used to place the rectangle. We know that if our mouse goes over this value we'll want out rectangle to appear, we can write that below like this:

```
if(mouseX > ?){
   fill(255, 0, 0)
   rect(?, ?, 100, 100)
}
```

- Great! Go ahead and test out what happens.
- Now we're back to the same problem we were at in the beginning, lets go ahead and add more conditions to our if statment. How long is our rectangle, at what point do we want it to stop appearing?


'''
if(mouseX > ? && mouseX < ?){
   fill(255, 0, 0)
   rect(?, ?, 100, 100)
}
```


-At this point you can go ahead and enter an *else* statment too try and help you trouble shoot. The way that I've been clearing the canvas is by saying 


```
else{
background(255)
}
```
- Now what you'll have to do is implement the same consitions for your Y axis.
