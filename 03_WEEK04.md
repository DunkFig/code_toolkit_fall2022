# Week 04
Hey everyone hope you had a good time working on the homework, were going to start off today by looking at recent piece that was created by Dries Depooter
then we're going to go over our homework, review some things from last week, and finally get into some **CONDITIONALS**

### Review
 - x & Y coordinates
 - 2D Primitives
 - RGBA value?
 - Draw VS Setup Function
 - Variables?
 - P5 Special Variables (Height, Width, mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY)
 - p5 Special Functions ( rand(), map(), dist() )

## Conditionals?

A big part of programming is settin of a series of actions if a variable meets a certain condition. Lets start our example off by using an internal p5 variable that we're familiar with: mouseX. Say we wanted a certain part of our code to fire after mouseX passed beyond 300th pixel. We can write this statement out like so:

```
function draw() {
if(mouseX > 300){
//you put what you want to happen here.
}
```

whatever we put inbetween these curly brackets will fire only after the condition is met. Lets try this out by entering the following code below:

```
function draw() {
  if(mouseX > 300){
     fill(255, 0, 0)
     rect(200, 0, 200, height)
  }
```

Did everything happen as you expected? What went differently? For me one of the things that I did not expect was the fact that the red rectangle stayed there even after I had taken my mouse away, why do you think this is? Well we had a conditional for what should happen ater our mouse goes over 300 pixels, but after that we haven't given any instructions for what our computer is supposed to do. We can use another conditional called **else** which gives us a way to say what we want to happen if the condition is *not* met.

```
function draw(){
  if(mouseX > 200){
    fill(255, 0, 0)
    rect(200, 0, 200, height)
  }else{
    background(255)
  }
  }
```
