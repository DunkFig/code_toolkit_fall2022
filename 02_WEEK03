# Week 03

This week were going to finally start animating some of our programs, adding interactivity, and using some more functions and variables which are part of p5.

### First Lets review some of the things that we've gone over so far:
- Cartesian Plane (Pixel coordinates)
- The setup() code block or 'function'
- RGBA values
- Using 2d Primitives (rect, ellipses, line, etc...)
- Using Variables (storing values inside of variables)
- adding variables and dividing, using variables that are internal to p5 (height, width, mouseX)
- Using the random function to add variability to our programs

### LETS GET INTERACTIVE
- First lets take a look at some interactive new media works:
